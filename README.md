# SpeechRecognition
Swift 3 iOS app. Using Apple's voice recognition to transcribe a users voice to text and displays ont the screen. Users can also change the background color by speaking to the app.
The app also saves the background color to memory so it is already set when the user opens up the app again.

### Note: Apple's voice recognition isn't perfect, sometimes you will say the color and nothing will happen.
This app is still in beta.
